<h1>DermaDesigner</h1>

Modified/Updated version of the Royal Derma Designer addon. Open the menu with the console command "open_dd", and drag/drop components onto the opened frame.

Important things that should be coming:
1. Fix save/load (done)
2. Live editing of paint functions (In progress)
3. Add most of the element metafunctions
4. Font designer/creator
5. Create persistent themes for vgui elements
